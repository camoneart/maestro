## Dashboard Features

### Real-time Overview

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your orchestra members:

- **Statistics Cards**: Total worktrees, active count, attention needed, GitHub linked
- **Worktree Grid**: Visual cards for each worktree with status indicators
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 30 seconds automatically
- **Interactive Actions**: Direct editor and terminal integration

### Worktree Status Indicators

Each worktree card displays:

#### Visual Indicators
- **üìç** Main worktree (repository root)
- **üéº** Regular orchestra member
- **Color coding**: Different colors for status and health

#### Status Badges
- **Issue Badge**: GitHub issue integration (`ISSUE #123`)
- **PR Badge**: GitHub pull request integration (`PR #456`)  
- **Template Badge**: Template used for creation (`feature`, `bugfix`)
- **Health Badges**: 
  - **Stale**: No commits for 30+ days
  - **Uncommitted**: Has uncommitted changes

### Interactive Actions

Each worktree provides action buttons:

#### Editor Integration
Opens worktree in preferred editor (Cursor ‚Üí VSCode ‚Üí fallback)

#### Terminal Integration
Opens new terminal window in worktree directory (macOS Terminal app)

## Web Interface

The dashboard runs on `http://localhost:8765` by default and provides:

- **Real-time status monitoring** of all worktrees
- **Health checks** for staleness and uncommitted changes
- **GitHub integration** showing linked issues and PRs
- **Direct actions** to open in editor or terminal

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/worktrees` - Returns comprehensive worktree data
- `POST /api/open-editor` - Opens worktree in editor
- `POST /api/open-terminal` - Opens worktree in terminal

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   ```bash
   # Use different port
   mst dashboard --port 8080
   ```

2. **Editor integration not working**
   ```bash
   # Ensure Cursor or VSCode is installed
   which cursor  # or: which code
   ```
